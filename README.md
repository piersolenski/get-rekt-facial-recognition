# Get Rekt Facial Recognition

Setup:
````
$ bower install
````

- Open directory on a server.

## Little extra for first timers:
```
# install nodeenv within your virtualenv
pip install nodeenv

# install node
nodeenv -p

# deactivate you virtualenv (to avoid some known issues)
deactivate

# activate your virtualenv again
workon your_virtualenv_name

# install bower
npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower

# Now you can install the app with bower
bower install

# easiest way of running the app is with http-server (any other server would do though)
# install http-server
npm install http-server -g

# run it
http-server

# browse to 127.0.0.1:8080

```
