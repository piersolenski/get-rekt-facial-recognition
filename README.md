# Get Rekt Facial Recognition

Built as part of the Get Rekt hackathon, this is a component in a larger photobooth app.

This repo is designed to take an image, then composite random [Montage Parody](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/montage-parodies) related images over the top of it. It uses facial recognition to places glasses on faces. Whilst it can be run in a standalone scenario, it was originally run on a server, where phantom.js would headlessly generate an image from the resulting output.

## Setup:
Install dependencies:
````
$ bower install
````

Open directory on a server!
